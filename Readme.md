Hey guys :-) 

After spending all day Sunday on this thing, I finally have it up and running! Introducing: [i]Jerricha's[/i], a ParagonChat Database Utility.

[b]What does it do?[/b]
Jerrichas is an automated tool where you can take your /costumesave file and plug it straight into the ParagonChat database, without manually having to query and figure out which fields go where, potentially corrupting your DB.

[b]How does it work?[/b]
First, you need Python 3. Next, you open up . You need to set two global variables, and you're ready to go.

Some things [i]Jerrichas[/i] currently does not do, but will in the future:
* Update your proportions. Jerrichas currently just replaces costume parts
* Change your account characters' names, class, origin, 
* A GUI? Possible web app for user friendliness (and so people don't need to install Python!)

Upcoming features and fixes:
* Bug fixes
* Major code refactoring and documentation to share with the community
* Compilation into a .exe / .dmg binary
